# North West Golf Society

# Project Goals
Aim of this project was to create a fully responsive, interactive website for a local golf society. This website would act as a central hub for existing members. It would also be a place prospective would-be members can visit in order to learn about this particular society and the events it holds and what trips they may be going on in the near future. 
The following information needs to be easily accessible to users who visit the site within a few clicks -
* The size of the society.
* Who can join?
* Is there a membership fee?
* Past/Future Events. 
* What level of experience do you need to join?
* How to join?
* Contact information.
* Links to social media accounts.
* Can other golf societies visit the site in order to arrange a round?

## User Goals
* As a new user, I want to be able to find information about the Society, so I can determine if I want to join.
* As a new user, I want to be able to be able to see images of previous events, to see if they look like something I would enjoy.
* As a new user, I want to be able to access any social media accounts the Society may have, in order to see I know any existing members and gain a gereater understanding of what the society entails.
* As a new user I would like to find a contact form or information to enquire about joining or arranging an inter-society golf match.
* As a new user, I want a clear navigation menu, so I can operate the site easily.
* As a returning user, I would like to see results from previous events, to see where I placed.
* As a returning user, I would like to be able to see what upcoming fixtures/events there maybe, to see if I can attend. 

## Owner Goals
* Publicity for society.
* Bigger reach.
* Organise members/users.
* Advertise upcoming fixtures.
